A very small yet powerful example of a real time web chat using Node, Express
and Faye.

## Prepare the ground

- [Download and install node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/)
- Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Run

- Run the server: `node server.js`
- Open [http://localhost:8000/client.html](http://localhost:8000/client.html)
- Have fun :)

## Redistribution

This example was made for my lightning talk on
[Caipira √Ågil 2012](http://www.caipiraagil.com/). But you can use it for your
own study, or for a talk of yours if you want. You just have to give me some
credit (see LICENSE for more info).
